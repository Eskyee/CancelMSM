# Cancel Mainstream Media

Claim back your sanity, block them all.

We believe that mainstream media, on top of spreading fake information, cause very avoidable social clashes which destabilize your country, community, and more importantly, your own sanity.

Mainstream media will make you hate people who you would have, in other circumstances, have fun with, and collaborated with.

The best medication is to avoid them from taking your attention by using several tools preventing you to see and react, and thus preventing you from being manipulated.

We advise you to follow news, not from mainstream media but from specific journalists who have repeatedly demonstrated integrity to their work.

If you think you are too intelligent to be manipulated, you are wrong, nobody is. While we can't know if we are being manipulated, we all recognize those who try to manipulate, this repository is about cancelling them.

This repository will not make a distinction between "legit mainstream media" and "illegitimate mainstream media", this is for you to choose. If you don't have time to choose, the sanest default is to block all of them.

## How to use this repository
